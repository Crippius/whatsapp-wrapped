# whatsapp-wrapped

## Description
This repositiÃ¬ory contains the project I developed during the summmer of '22, in which I created an API that, 
when you input an exported whatsapp text file from a group/direct chat, a pdf file is created with lots of informations (IN ITALIAN ONLY (FOR NOW))

## How to export a Whatsapp chat
* Go to the chat you want to want to know more
* Click the three dots on the top right of your screen 
* Click "More" >
* Click "Export chat" 
* Click "Without media" (Important!)
* Download it into your device 
* Use it in this script!

## Functionalities
Possible plots:
* Number of messages from the start of your texting journey to today (line plot)
* Most used emojis (bar plot)
* Most used words (bar plot / wordcloud)
* Number of messages per weekday (spider plot)
* Most active people (bar plot)
* Number of messages per time of day (line plot)

You can also get info about
* Total number of messages
* Most active day/month/year/weekday
* Longest (in)active streak
* Average response time
* And much more!!!

## What's Next?
I would love to create a website in which everyone can get an interesting analysis of their chat history without much trouble,
this is why I'm learning HTML/CSS/JS to create it! Hope everything goes to plan!
