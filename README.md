## Description
This repositi√¨ory contains the project I developed during the summmer of '22, in which I created a script 
that takes an exported .txt file from a Whatsapp chat and
outputs a PDF that explores lots of interesting information and data about its conversations through graphs
and made-up messages.

The program supports both IOS and Android exported files.
The supported languages are English and Italian.

## How to export a Whatsapp chat
* Go to the chat you want to want to know more
* Click the three dots on the top right of your screen 
* Click "More"
* Click "Export chat" 
* Click "Without media"
* Download it into your device 
* Use it in this script!

## Functionalities
Possible plots:
* Number of messages from the start of your texting journey to today (line plot)
* Most used emojis (bar plot)
* Most used words (bar plot / wordcloud)
* Number of messages per weekday (spider plot)
* Most active people (bar plot)
* Number of messages per time of day (line plot)

You can also get info about
* Total number of messages
* Most active day/month/year/weekday
